# Data Analysis Portfolio

## This is my public github site where I showcase Kaggle projects that I am currently working on

The goal of these projects is to use Python programming in Jupyter Notebook to explore, clean and analyse data to derive meaningful and actionable insights. These are a work in progress and I will update as regularly as possible. I am design conscious and believe that the presentation of data is fundamental and constitutes the second half of the journey of a data analysis task.
